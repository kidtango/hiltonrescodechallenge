# hiltonrescodechallenge

This is a full-stack challenge that should demonstrate knowledge of GraphQL, ReactJS, TypeScript and Node.js. 

Create an app that simulates a basic hotel reservations system. Use node 8 or newer.

A reservation should have the following fields:

- id

- guest name

- hotel name

- arrival date

- departure date

 

The application should support:

- a query for retrieving all reservations

- a query for retrieving a reservation by ID

- a mutation for creating a reservation Reservations should be persisted to a NoSQL data store.

 

Ideally, have a running instance of the app somewhere and place your code on GitHub.
